# Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem
Posed as an artificial intelligence concept, a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is
<...a factored representation for each state: a set of variables, each of which has a value.  A problem is solved when eache variable has a value that satisfies all the constraints on the variable.> (from *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russel & Norvig)
In order to educate myself on
- constraint satisfaction problems
- command line git
- sudoku
I intend to write a CSP algorithm that can take the beginning state of a basic 9x9 sudoku puzzle, solve it, and output the corresponding solution.
